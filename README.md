## :books: Required Libraries and Language for this project

- `Python` is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics
- `Streamlit` is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
- `PyOWM` is a client Python wrapper library for OpenWeatherMap web APIs. It allows quick and easy consumption of OWM data from Python applications via a simple object model and in a human-friendly fashion.
- `Matplotlib` is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.
- `DateTime` provides a DateTime data type . DateTime objects represent instants in time and provide interfaces for controlling its representation without affecting the absolute value of the object.
- `Plotly` is a Python library interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.
- Python `Open Weather Map API`
